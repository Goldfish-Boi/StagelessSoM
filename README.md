You only goal is ascend.

The modernization of the classic Tower Obby genre produced by me! Here in this area you are able to play different obbies reaching into the sky. Their difficulties can range from an easy cake walk to the most stress inducing obstacles you can ever face. Where will your skills lie? Will you be able to reach the top?

The objective of the game is to complete various challenges in the form of obbies. You can play the game by entering any tower portal you find on the map and trying to reach its winpad which is at the end of the obby! Game can be difficult, have fun!
